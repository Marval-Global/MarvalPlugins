# Marval Integrations and the Marval Integration Platform

## Marval Integrations
This repository contains all the Marval integrations developed by Marval Global.
Please see https://integration.marval.cloud/ for information on each integration and a centralised place to download the integrations and get more information about each integration.


## Marval Integration Platform
The Marval Integration Platform, available here https://integration.marval.cloud/login, is a place to manage all of your integrations, as well as the central repository for all integrations.
Some advanced functions of our integrations require extra configuration which is not available in our integration architecture. In addition, on-premise customers can take advantage of our on-premise agent, allowing advanced integration functionality such as request creation and quick search, even where you do not have an internet accessible environment.

## Why have a Marval Integrations Platform?
Over the past few years, we've seen an increased demand for new integrations to software that is running on-premise or in the cloud. Many of our customers however do not have the time or skillset in-house to develop the integrations required which would help them run their business effectively. If an integration is developed, it may not be publicly releasable, or may be built with a very specific use-case in mind.

Our idea at Marval Global was to use our in-house extensive knowledge and experience of developing integrations, as well as best-practise service management principles to develop and release integrations for our customers. Integrations that are feature-complete, easy to use and stable. In addition, many of our customers run on-premise, so they do not have internet accessible environments. We did not want these customers to feel like second-class citizens, so we needed a way to be able to provide th the ability to also benefit from integrations which may need direct contact with a Marval environment (for instance, to facilitate request creation).

## Features available to all Marval Integration Customers

### Automated update notifications for each integration
As part of each integration architecture, the integration will check on each load if there is an update required, and will notify the user in the Marval plugin page if an updated is required. By simply clicking the download button on the page, you can obtain a new version of the integration.

### Regular integration updates
Marval Global has a dedicated team for integrations, and regularly updates integrations that we develop. Whether that is for new functions, bug fixes, or for API changes to other platforms, we are constantly looking for ways to provide value for our customers who utilise Marval.

### Access to all future integrations developed by Marval
Marval Global releases several integrations a quarter as part of our ongoing commitment to our customers. These integrations span from finance, to CI/CD platforms, to messaging.

### Priority on integration features and new integrations
As a customer of the Marval Integration Platform, you will get priority preference on suggestions/improvements and new integrations. Our Azure DevOps was one such integration which was prioritised through a customer request.

### Access to our on-premise agent for advanced integration functionality
The Marval on-premise agent securely connects you to the Integration Platform, to facilitate Marval requests to your on-premise Marval installation. This was originally developed for our Teams chatbot, to facilitate the creation of requests and searching with quick search.

### Access to our Integration Platform to create custom webhooks and configure existing integrations
The Marval Integration Platform allows you to manage all your Marval integrations, as well as other integrations you may want to run. You are able to configure your on-premise agent and create custom web hooks to other integrations.
